--Theme and plugin setup
Activate the "parai" theme (if has not been activated) under Appearance > themes.

--Create 10 dummy Articles
Add new Article under Articles > Add New
Add title, some description, images, videos and a "featured image" (on the right sidebar)
Notice 2 custom meta boxes called "Location:" at the bottom. 
The first "Location:" works and is a temporary solution until we get the Google Maps API.
For each Article, add different Lat Long values based on places in India (e.g., 13.799306828552597, 77.4906449858703). You can copy the lat long values by clicking a place in google map. right click on the marker and click the first option in the popup/menu.
Save article

** Check wp-content > themes > parai > functions.php and cpt_articles.php to se how this is coded **


--The front-end   
The Articles are shown in the frontend as cards.
There is also a map. 
The map contains example interaction. When the red marker is click, additional information is displayed.
** check wp-content > themes > index.php to see how this is coded **
