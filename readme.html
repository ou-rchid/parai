--Theme and plugin setup
Activate the "parai" theme (if has not been activated) under Appearance > themes.
Activate the plugins "CMB2" and "CMB2 Field Type: Google Maps" under Admin > Plugins.

--Create Articles
Add new Article under Articles > Add New
Add title, some description, images, videos and a featured image (on the right sidebar)
Notice 2 custom meta boxes called "Location:" at the bottom. 
The first Location works and is a temporary solution until we get the Google Maps API.
